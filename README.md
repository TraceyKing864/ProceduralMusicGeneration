# ProceduralMusicGeneration
This started as a project for my Embedded Systems class with 2 other individuals. 
I've since moved the code into a new repository for further development into
procedural generation, specifically with MIDI files. 

This program currently uses a library made by Craig Stuart Sapp (craigsapp), 
that allows MIDI file creation and manipulation with C.
